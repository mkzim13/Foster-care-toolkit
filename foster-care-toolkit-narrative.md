# Foster Care Toolkit Website — Project Narrative

## Instructional Problem

New foster parents often enter their first placement with limited experience and an urgent need for clear, reliable guidance. The first month of fostering involves navigating legal, medical, educational, and emotional responsibilities that can feel overwhelming without structured support. This project aimed to create an accessible, easy‑to‑navigate online toolkit that would help new foster parents understand their obligations, locate required forms, and build confidence during the critical first 30 days of placement.

## Audience Analysis

### Primary Audience: New Foster Parents

Our primary audience consisted of new foster parents working with the Children’s Home Society of North Carolina. These individuals had recently received their first placement and were seeking practical, trustworthy information to help them manage the early stages of fostering. Key audience characteristics included:

- Little or no prior experience with foster care procedures  
- High emotional load, balancing the needs of a newly placed child with unfamiliar requirements  
- Immediate need for clarity on legal, medical, and educational obligations  
- Desire for reassurance and guidance during a stressful transition  

### Secondary Audiences

Secondary audiences included caseworkers, social workers, placement specialists, and foster care support organizations. These stakeholders might use the toolkit to support families, reinforce guidance, or reference official forms and procedures.

## Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done Framework

We used a Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done model to clarify the core outcome:  
**Help new foster parents confidently navigate the first 30 days of placement.**

To achieve this outcome, the toolkit needed to support several key tasks:

- Understanding the requirements of the first seven days after placement  
- Navigating legal, medical, and educational responsibilities  
- Establishing trust and emotional support for the child  
- Learning how to collaborate effectively with caseworkers and other professionals  

These tasks shaped the structure, content, and level of detail in the toolkit.

## Instructional Problem Statement

To support new foster parents, we developed a digital guide that consolidates essential information, explains early placement requirements, and provides direct access to forms and resources. The goal was to reduce uncertainty, streamline the onboarding process, and empower foster parents to meet their responsibilities with confidence.

## Tools Used

We built the toolkit using Google Sites, which offered an accessible, user‑friendly platform for creating a structured, navigable website. Google Sites required no specialized technical skills, allowing the team to focus on content clarity and organization rather than web development. Its collaborative features enabled all team members to work concurrently, review updates in real time, and refine the site efficiently. The platform’s simple layout tools, embedded links, and page‑level navigation supported the creation of a clean, intuitive resource that new foster parents could explore with minimal friction.

## Reflection

This project reinforced the importance of designing instructional materials that balance clarity, accessibility, and emotional support. New foster parents face a steep learning curve during the first month of placement, and providing a centralized, easy‑to‑navigate resource can significantly reduce stress and confusion. The project also highlighted the value of collaborative tools, iterative refinement, and thoughtful audience analysis—skills that translate directly to professional technical communication.
